  { title: "Home in Your Smile", date: "July 19, 2025", content: `Every moment with you feels like home, 
A place where my heart is never alone.
Your laughter lingers, soft and clear,
And every whisper draws me near.

The stars may fall, the night may fade,
But your warmth is a light that will never jade.
In your grasp, I find my home,
A tender promise, ours alone.

Brown eyes that spark a quiet joy,
A warmth no cold could ever destroy.
The world whirls on, but I’m not swayed,
Lost in your gaze, I’ve found my stay.

Each word you speak, a melody sweet,
Each heartbeat of yours makes mine complete.
In storms or sunshine, in joy or fear,
My home is your heart, always near.

I’ll hold you close, through all life’s miles,
Finding eternity in your soft smiles.
Time cannot steal what we have grown,
For every moment with you feels like home.

With every hug, the world feels right,
Your love is my shelter in darkest night.
Even when silence surrounds the air,
I feel your heartbeat always there.

No treasure compares, no gold could shine,
Like the quiet magic of calling you mine.
Forever isn’t long enough to show,
How much my heart loves you, you know.

I find my calm in the way you stay,
In the little things that light our day.
You make the ordinary feel brand new,
With every gentle thing you do.

When the world shouts and I lose my way,
Your presence guides me back to day.
You still the whirlwind, you ease my mind,
A steady solace I never thought I’d find.

Every step feels lighter when you’re near,
Every doubt fades, every fear.
You don’t have to try or prove a thing,
Your love is enough, it’s everything.

In crowded rooms or quiet space,
I search for you, your familiar face.
Because wherever you happen to be,
That’s where home feels like to me.

I don’t need stars to light my night,
Just your hands to hold me tight.
Wherever life’s winds blow me through,
I’m safe, I’m calm, I’m loved with you.

So if the world should change its tone,
And paths feel unsure, unknown,
I’ll follow the light I’ve always known, 
Home has always been your smile alone.` },
  { title: "Seven Months With You", date: "July 27, 2025", content: `When I look at you, the world softens,
Every worry fades, every chaos lessens.
You don’t just hold my hand; you hold my heart,
And suddenly, I feel whole, not parts.

With you, I can be loud or silent,
Messy or calm, hesitant or violent.
You see me, really see me,
And it makes every broken piece feel free.

Seven months have passed like a gentle tide,
Each day with you, I’ve learned to confide.
Every laugh, every tear, every quiet night,
Has stitched our souls in the softest light.

The way you smile lingers in my chest,
A warmth that turns my fear to rest.
Your laughter spills into my quiet,
Filling the spaces I didn’t know were empty.

I love how your presence pulls me close,
How even the ordinary feels grandiose.
A glance, a touch, a simple phrase,
It reshapes my nights, rewrites my days.

You give me a stillness I never knew,
A pulse beneath my skin that feels like truth.
With you, life isn’t rushed or hollow,
Every moment is full, every tomorrow I follow.

You ripple through me, soft and deep,
A storm, a hush, a current I keep.
It’s awe in my chest, it’s breathless hands,
A space with you where forever stands.

The way you see me changes all I know,
Your quiet strength lets my own light grow.
Not just someone I love, but the reason life feels true,
Forever, deeply, I love you.` },
  { title: "For All You Are", date: "July 29, 2025", content: `You hold me steady in quiet ways,
A gentle strength that fills my days.
Without a word, without demand,
You lift me up and help me stand.

Your care is quiet, soft, and true,
A tender light that sees me through.
Every small act, every thoughtful sign,
Shows the depth of your heart in mine.

You notice moments I don’t show,
The ones too small for others to know.
Yet in your eyes, they all have weight,
And make my soul feel truly safe.

Your patience holds me when I break,
A calm that settles with every take.
I feel your presence deep and near,
A warmth that whispers, “I am here.”

With you, the world feels softer, kind,
A gentle refuge for my mind.
No need for grandeur, no need for fame,
Every moment with you is never the same.

Your quiet thoughtfulness, your steady hand,
The little ways you help me stand.
All that you are, all that you do,
I see it clearly, and I thank you.

You turn the ordinary into bright,
A calm that lingers, pure and right.
Every gesture, tender and true,
Leaves me endlessly in awe of you.

For all you give, for all you are,
For the gentle light you carry far.
I want you to know, with all my heart,
Loving you is the best part.` },
  { title: "Only You, Always", date: "August 4, 2025", content: `I see your gaze in every dream,
Your whispers soft, they make me beam.
No other heart could steal my fun,
I want you, babe, my only one.

When shadows fall and nights grow long,
It’s with your arms I feel I belong.
No fleeting touch could take your place,
Your love’s my home, my safest space.

I’ve walked through paths both dark and wide,
But only you stand firm by my side.
No whispers of another man I crave,
With you, my soul feels truly brave.

Your eyes, a fire I can’t ignore,
A pull so strong I can’t fight nor bore.
No other hands, no other kiss,
Could match this quiet, endless bliss.

I’ve dreamed of futures far and near,
But only you make them crystal clear.
No wandering heart will lead me astray,
I want you now, forever to stay.

Through storms and winds, through sun and rain,
I’d choose your love again and again.
No fleeting flame could tempt my heart,
It’s you, and only you, from the start.

I don’t desire a love that strays,
Or fleeting nights and empty days.
I want the man whose soul is mine,
Together, strong, through space and time ;3.

So here I stand, my truth in hand,
I hope you feel, I hope you understand.
No other man will hold my heart,
It’s you, my love, my only part.` },
  { title: "Held in The Fold of You", date: "August 6, 2025", content: `I am wrapped in the quiet of your arms,
A gentle shield from the world’s alarms.
No rush, no noise, just the soft embrace,
Where every worry finds its resting place.

Your touch is a whisper against my skin,
A tender warmth that lives deep within.
Each heartbeat hums a lullaby for two,
And in your closeness, I am made anew.

The world outside may turn fast and loud,
But here, it’s calm, beneath your cloud.
Every sigh and subtle leaning near,
Turns fleeting moments into something clear.

Fingers entwined, the simplest of signs,
Speak louder than the grandest of lines.
In that closeness, everything feels true,
I melt away, just being near you.

The way you pause, to notice, to care,
The gentle touches only we can share.
No need for promises, the silence says it all,
In your arms, I never fear a fall.

Time races on, yet here it slows its pace,
Each brush of your hand leaves a tender trace.
The hours slip by, yet linger in your skin,
And every touch feels endless, warm within.

Your warmth seeps deep where words cannot reach,
A quiet lesson only love can teach.
The world may turn, yet one thing stays true,
My heart is safe, cradled next to you.

Forever is small when measured in this way,
A heartbeat’s span, a breath, a soft display.
And in your closeness, in your gentle hold,
I find my home, my heart, my soul consoled.` },
  { title: "The Bond I Cherish", date: "September 17, 2025", content: `I love the way you’re close to me,
A bond so strong, it sets me free.
No treasure shines, no jewel can show,
The depth of love I’ve come to know.

Your voice, your touch, the way you care,
A gentle truth that’s always there.
With every smile, with every glance,
You give my heart its sweetest chance.

I hold our closeness deep inside,
A steady love I cannot hide.
Through every moment, near or far,
You are my peace, my guiding star.

The way we share, the way we trust,
Turns simple days to gold and dust.
No words can match, no song can sing,
The joy our bond will always bring.

I love the way you make me whole,
You fill the corners of my soul.
Together strong, together kind,
A love like ours is hard to find.

I cherish you, I cherish us,
A bond that blooms in faith and trust.
Forever true, forever near,
A love that grows year after year.

No storm can shake, no time erase,
The warmth I see upon your face.
For in your heart, I’ve found my home,
A place where I am never alone.

So let me say, with words sincere,
I love this closeness we hold dear.
Forever bound, just you and me,
A love I’ll guard eternally.
` },
  { title: "Hours With You", date: "September 18, 2025", content: `I like how your hand fits in mine,
How being close feels like everything’s fine.
Your head on my shoulder, soft and true,
I could stay like this forever with you.

The sun hits your face, warm and slow,
And I just want this moment to never go.
Time feels small when we’re together,
Nothing else matters, not now, not ever.

A kiss on your cheek, gentle and sweet,
And my heart skips a tiny beat.
The world outside can wait its turn,
Here with you is all I yearn.

Fingers brushing, arms pulled tight,
Minutes stretch but I don’t mind.
I just want to stay with you like this,
Holding every moment, every kiss.

The world grows quiet, soft and slow,
I love how being near lets time just go.
Your breathing close, calm and sweet,
It’s the little things that make me complete.

I trace your face, the curve of your jaw,
I hold you close without a flaw.
Nothing fancy, nothing grand,
Just our hearts pressed together, hand in hand.

Rain outside taps on the pane,
But inside, there’s no room for pain.
A hug that lingers, soft and long,
Being near you is where I belong.

Soft whispers, quiet and near,
The world shrinks down when you are here.
A brush of cheeks, a squeeze of hand,
Every gentle touch feels unplanned.

Time drifts slow, yet I want it to stay,
Every small moment with you replay.
Your presence lingers inside my chest,
Every heartbeat tells me I’m blessed.

When morning comes, I don’t let go,
I hold onto the hours that move too slow.
Time may pass, the world may spin,
But I’ll always start my day with you within.` },
  { title: "Hold Me Close", date: "October 16, 2025", content: `I love how you hold me like I’m yours,
Fingers tracing paths only love explores.
Pressing close, so I can feel your heart,
A warmth that lingers, never wants to part.

Your cheek against mine, soft and near,
Every brush makes the world disappear.
You cling like the stars cling to night,
And I sink deeper in your light.

Your arms wrap tight, don’t let me go,
I love the way you take it slow.
Every hug, every squeeze, every small touch,
Makes me love you even too much.

Fingers brushing, holding tight,
I want more of you, all day and night.
Every glance, every quiet claim,
Your closeness sets my heart aflame.

A kiss on my cheek, soft and sweet,
Your clingy ways make me complete.
The world can wait, the clock can spin,
All I want is your warmth on my skin.

Even in class, you find your way,
A quiet touch that makes my day.
A gentle hand, a little lean,
Moments with you feel like a dream.

I love how you stay, refusing space,
Your clinginess is my favorite place.
Your warmth presses where words can’t reach,
Every small touch is a loving speech.

Your presence stays in every glance,
Even from afar, you find a chance.
Every shared smile, every quiet cue,
Makes me want to stay stuck with you.

I love it when you pull me close,
When holding me feels like the only dose.
No need for words, no need for sound,
Clingy love is where I’m found.

Every cheek kiss, every gentle squeeze,
I treasure all the ways you tease.
You cling because you love me true,
And I cling right back to you.

When the bell rings and class is through,
I carry these moments of clingy you.
Time may pass, the world may spin,
But I’ll keep you close, where it all begins.` },
  { title: "Always Pulling", date: "October 29, 2025", content: `I can’t stop looking for you,
Even when you’re just across the room.
Your hand brushes mine, and it’s enough,
I’m tethered to you, caught in your pull.

A glance, a nudge, a quiet smile,
And suddenly I’ve been here a while.
Time bends around your every move,
I’m drawn in, and I can’t undo.

I hold your hand, soft and true,
Every touch pulls me closer to you.
A gentle lean, a little squeeze,
All the small things put my heart at ease.

I catch your eyes when you don’t know,
It’s like a secret the world can’t show.
Every heartbeat beats a little fast,
I want this, this pull to always last.

I love how your voice feels near,
Every word you say I want to hear.
Your smile lights up my quiet day,
Being with you makes everything okay.

Every laugh, every little tease,
Your presence fills me with ease.
I keep your sweetness in my chest,
Every moment with you feels like the best.

I want to reach, I want to pull,
Every glance, every touch, I can’t control.
You anchor me, I can’t resist,
Every move you make feels like a twist.

A gentle kiss pressed on my cheek,
Your warmth is everything I seek.
Even when class ends and we part,
I carry your love deep in my heart.

And when the bell finally rings,
I feel your warmth in the smallest things.
A stolen glance, a hand held tight,
Keeps me thinking of you all night.` },
  { title: "Only You", date: "November 3, 2025", content: `Others talk, but they don’t see,
The little things that mean to me.
Words fall flat, and smiles feel small,
But you, you catch the heart of it all.

Some try to guess, some try to know,
But only you make my feelings show.
A look, a touch, a quiet glance,
Turns ordinary moments into romance.

They rush and push, they try too hard,
But you move softly, always on guard.
You sense what I need without a word,
Even when no one else has heard.

Others laugh, but it’s not the same,
They never notice the little flame.
But you lean close and understand,
You hold my heart gently in your hand.

Some speak loud, some speak fast,
But your quiet ways make me last.
Every glance, every little smile,
You make me feel seen all the while.

They try to guide, they try to steer,
But you just stay, and I feel near.
No pushing, no forcing, just soft and true,
I can’t explain it, but it’s all you.

Others pass, and I barely care,
Their empty words float in the air.
But your presence, soft and kind,
Always lingers in my heart and mind.

Some give gifts, some give praise,
But you give me comfort in gentle ways.
A smile, a whisper, a quiet hold,
Makes me feel loved more than words told.

Others watch, but they don’t see,
The little things that mean to me.
Your understanding, quiet and real,
Is the sweetest thing I’ll ever feel.

And in the end, it’s only true,
No one else compares to you.
In every way, big or small,
You understand me, and that’s all.` },
  { title: "Echoes of You", date: "November 29, 2025", content: `I still catch myself reaching for you,
Even though I know there’s nothing to do.
Care doesn’t vanish when it’s ignored,
I’m tethered to a love left unexplored.

I open my phone, desperate for a sign,
Hoping today you might reach out, even a line.
But nothing appears, only silent weight,
And every heartbeat pounds in quiet hate.

I remember your cheek, soft and near,
Your whisper, your laugh, everything dear.
Now I reach for you and touch only air,
Every hallway, every glance, you’re not there.

You promised me you’d talk, you’d stay,
That you’d reach out, not drift away.
But silence swallowed every vow,
And I’m left aching, trying to figure out how.

I replay the last touch, the softest lean,
The cheek I kissed, the moments unseen.
How did normal twist into this quiet hell,
Where your presence lingers but you never dwell?

Where are you, Sam? 'Cause I’m right here.
Your absence presses in, heavy and severe.
I cling to the fragments, the warmth, the glow,
And I ache for you more than you’ll ever know.

I still worry for you, though you’re not near,
I ache for the warmth that once felt so clear.
You’re present sometimes, then drift far away,
And I’m left here hurting, not knowing what to say.

Do you even think of me the way I do?
Or have I already disappeared from you?
I hold onto fragments, the warmth, the glow,
And I ache for you more than you’ll ever know.

I want to ask, to scream, to demand,
Being in this state feels like I'm stabbed.
Waiting, aching, bleeding through,
Haunted forever by echoes of you.` },
  { title: "The Quiet Things We Share", date: "December 16, 2025", content: `Your lips press lightly on my cheek,
A warmth that stays, no need to speak.
It’s small, it’s quiet, it feels like home,
A thread of closeness that’s ours alone.

Hugs that linger when the world is cold,
Filling spaces no one else can hold.
I rest in you, the pause, the calm,
A fleeting peace, a quiet home.

We share small looks, a quiet grin,
Little moments where we begin.
No one sees, no one can know,
The way our closeness seems to grow.

We walk slow on the way to the canteen,
Gentle words fill the space between.
Every glance leaves a quiet trace,
A memory that time cannot erase.

We talk for hours, letting time slide,
Words we share, no need to hide.
No cold silence, no empty space,
Only the warmth I find in your grace.

A kiss at noon, a hug after class,
Little moments I hope will last.
They settle softly, steady and true,
A quiet warmth I feel from you.

I wait for you, you wait for me,
No push, no pressure, no grand decree.
No jewel, no gift, no shining throne,
Just the hours we share, ours alone.

The way you lean, the way you stay,
Calms the restless tides of my day.
No poem could capture, no words could bind,
The quiet love that stays in mind.

And when the years fold over time,
I’ll hold these moments, small, sublime.
No fading love, no last regret,
The best of life is what we met.` },
